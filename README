#rshell
rshell is a command shell that uses C++ to make system calls.

It is not very advanced, however it can run multiple commands in one line using the connectors "||", "&&", and/or ";".

|| means that if the first command successfully runs, then the command directly after is not run. If the first command fails to run, then the second command is run.

&& means that the second command is run only if the first command successfully runs.

; is used to separate different commands.

#How to run rshell

```
#Bugs
```
1. Passing in a blank argument does not work.

2. After a command that is not valid is called exit must be called twice before it is actually executed.

3. cd with absolute paths doesn't work

4. ls -R doesn't work properly

5. Piping with input redirection and output redirection doesn't work

```

Furthermore it supports comments which are denoted by "#".
